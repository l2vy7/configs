# configs
zephyr configs made by me (how surprising)

## install
download the config file and drag it into this folder (press win+r, paste it in, and enter).   
```%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\project-halcyon\configurations```

## servers
- Mineplex (made originally by Zastix but modified by me to include an hvh version.
- Hive (coming soon)
- Lifeboat (coming soon i promise)
