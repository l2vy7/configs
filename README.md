# configs
zephyr configs made by me (how surprising)

## install
download the config file and drag it into this folder (press win+r, paste it in, and enter).   
```%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\project-halcyon\configurations```

## servers
- Mineplex (made originally by Zastix but modified by me to include an HvH version.)

## other info
- Everything works on Mineplex HvH, including antivoid.
    - Binds (both regular and HvH):
        - LongJump: TAB
        - Scaffold: R
        - Aura: Z
        - Speed: X
    - Many modules are enabled by default for performance and ease-of-use.
